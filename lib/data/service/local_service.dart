// wrap API endpoints and expose asynchronous response objects, such as Future and Stream objects

//Examples of endpoints that services might wrap include:
//
// The underlying platform, like iOS and Android APIs
// REST endpoints
// Local files

// Services and repositories have a many-to-many relationship.
// A single Repository can use several services, and a service can be used by multiple repositories.
